# Making Requests

## Content Negotiation

Clients using the api should specify that they accept responses using the
`application/vnd.api+json` format, for convenience we will also accept `application/json`
since it is the default for many popular client libraries.

The Server will respond with a `Content-Type` header that mirrors the format
requested by the Client.

## Pagination

Where applicable, the server allows requests to limit the number of results
returned via pagination. To paginate the primary data, supply pagination information
to the query portion of the request using the limit and offset parameters.  
To fetch items 11 through 30 you would specify a limit of 10 and an offset of 10:

```shell
curl "https://api.dc01.gamelockerapp.com/shards/na/matches?limit=20&offset=10" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer aaa.bbb.ccc" \
  -H "X-TITLE-ID: semc-vainglory" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.api+json"
```

If not specified, the server will default `limit=50` and `offset=0`.

## Sorting

All resource collections have a default sort order.  In addition, some resources
provide the ability to sort according to one or more criteria ("sort fields").

```shell
curl "https://api.dc01.gamelockerapp.com/shards/na/matches?sort=createdAt" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer aaa.bbb.ccc" \
  -H "X-TITLE-ID: semc-vainglory" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.api+json"
```

The above example should return the oldest articles first, meaning that
the default sort order is always ascending. Ascending corresponds to the
standard order of numbers and letters, i.e. A to Z, 0 to 9).  For dates and times,
ascending means that earlier values precede later ones e.g. 1/1/2000 will sort
ahead of 1/1/2001.

If sort fields are is prefixed with a minus, the order will be changed to descending.

```shell
curl "https://api.dc01.gamelockerapp.com/shards/na/matches?sort=-createdAt" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer aaa.bbb.ccc" \
  -H "X-TITLE-ID: semc-vainglory" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.api+json"
```

The above example should return the newest articles first.

## JSON-P Callbacks

You can send a ?callback parameter to any GET call to have the results wrapped in a JSON function. This is typically used when browsers want to embed content in web pages by getting around cross domain issues. The response includes the same data output as the regular API, plus the relevant HTTP Header information.

```shell
curl https://api.dc01.gamelockerapp.com/status?callback=foo
```

```javascript
foo({
  "meta": {  
    "content-length":34,
    "content-type":"application/json; charset=utf-8",
    "status":200
  },
  "data": {
    ...  // the data
  }
})
```

## Cross Origin Resource Sharing
The API supports Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for AJAX requests from any origin.
You can read the CORS W3C Recommendation, or this intro from the HTML 5 Security Guide.

Here's a sample request sent from a browser hitting http://example.com:

```shell
curl -i https://api.dc01.gamelockerapp.com/status -H "Origin: http://example.com"
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  ...
  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
  Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Content-Length
```
This is what the CORS preflight request looks like:

```shell
curl -i https://api.dc01.gamelockerapp.com/status -H "Origin: http://example.com" -X OPTIONS
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  ...
  Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Origin,X-Title-Id,Authorization
  Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET,POST,OPTIONS
  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
  Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400
```

# Matches

Matches records are created every time players complete a game session. Each Match
contains high level information about the game session, including info like
duration, gameMode, and more.  Each Match has two Rosters.   


## Rosters

```json
{
  "type": "roster",
  "id": "eca49808-d510-11e6-bf26-cec0c932ce01",
  "attributes": {
    "stats": {
      "acesEarned": 2,
      "gold": 32344,
      "etc..."
    }
  },
  "relationships": {
    "team": {
      "data": {
        "type": "team",
        "id": "753d464c-d511-11e6-bf26-cec0c932ce01"
      }
    },
    "participants": {
      "data": [
        {
          "type": "participant",
          "id": "eca49a7e-d510-11e6-bf26-cec0c932ce01"
        },
        "etc..."
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Rosters track the scores of each opposing group of Participants. If players entered
matchmaking as a team, the Roster will have a related Team.  Rosters have many Participants
objects, one for each member of the Roster. Roster objects are only meaningful
within the context of a Match and are not exposed as a standalone resource.

## Participants

```json
{
  "type": "participant",
  "id": "ea77c3a7-d44e-11e6-8f77-0242ac130004",
  "attributes": {
    "actor": "*Hero009*",
    "stats": {
      "assists": 4,
      "crystalMineCaptures": 1,
      "deaths": 2,
      "farm": 49.25,
      "etc..."
    }
  }
}
```
Participant objects track each member in a Roster.  Participants may be
anonymous Players, registered Players, or bots. In the case where the Participant
is a registered Player, the Participant will have a single Player relationship.
Participant objects are only meaningful within the context of a Match and are
not exposed as a standalone resource.

### URL Parameters

Parameter | Description

ID | The ID of the match to retrieve

## Where is my match?

We purposefully do not allow certain matches to be displayed.  Specifically, for
 a match to be valid it must meet all of the following requirements.

  1.  The game mode must be one of the following:
    * ranked
    * casual
    * private
    * private_party_draft_match
    * private_party_aral_match
    * private_party_blitz_match
    * casual_aral
    * blitz_pvp_ranked
  1. The match must NOT have ended with one of the following statuses:
    * exitpractice
    * notenoughplayers
  1. In order to allow our pro-players to practice, we also reject matches where there are no ranked players and the game mode is private.

### GETTING STARTED:  
<br>
######Q: Where can I sign up for an API key?    
A: On the [Vainglory API Developer Portal](https://developer.vainglorygame.com)

######Q: I have my API Key. What do I do now?  
A: To get started, take a look at the [Documentation](https://developer.vainglorygame.com/docs) where you can learn how to use the API.

######Q: Where is the documentation?  
A: Documentation is [right here.](https://developer.vainglorygame.com/docs)

######Q: How far along in development is the API?  
A: The API is currently in Alpha. Alpha software can be unstable and could cause crashes or data loss. Alpha software may not contain all of the features that are planned for the final version.

######Q: I’ve never coded anything before and I have a sweet idea, how do I get started?  
A: Head over to our public [Discord](https://discord.me/vaingloryapi) and chat with some of the developers and designers who are already building tools with the API. Many of them would be happy to help you get started on your project!

######Q: When I signed up, it said I was enrolled in the Community Free Tier, what does that mean?  
A: The Community Free Tier allows you to begin developing and testing your app/tool using live data. It comes with a default rate limit of 10 requests per minute that is adequate for testing purposes. 

######Q: My dashboard says that my rate limit is 10 requests per minute. How can I request a higher rate limit?  
A: The default rate limit of 10 requests per minute is for testing/development purposes only. Once you are ready to launch your tool, you can request a higher rate limit by emailing api@superevilmegacorp.com

######Q: What can I do with the data I get from the API?  
A: Build awesome tools for yourself, or for the community! You can derive any information you’d like from the data, but you cannot scrape or store all of the data from the API.  For a full list of what is acceptable and what is not, check out the [Terms of Service](https://developer.vainglorygame.com/terms-of-service).

######Q: Will you charge for use of the API?  
A: The API is free for non-commercial use.  For a commercial license, send an email to api@superevilmegacorp.com

######Q: How do I know if I need a commercial license?  
A: If you are doing any of the following, you will need to register for a commercial license:  running ads, charging a fee to access your tool, selling aggregated data, monetizing on the data provided in any way.

######Q: What can I do with a commercial license?  
A: With the API still in Alpha, we are not distributing commercial licenses yet.  We will have more information on this soon.  In the meantime, you can check the Terms of Service to see what are acceptable uses for the API.

######Q: How do I get a commercial license?  
A: With the API still in Alpha, we are not distributing commercial licenses yet.  If you have further questions, or want to chat about it more, send an email to api@superevilmegacorp.com

######Q: If I have a question regarding the API, what do I do?

### Development/Troubleshooting:  
<br>
######Q: The documentation seems wrong. What do I do now?  
A: With the API still in Alpha, it’s very possible the docs are not completely up-to-date. We’re updating the docs as we go! You can also contribute to the docs on [Github](https://github.com/madglory/gamelocker-vainglory) if you’d like to make some changes.

######Q: I just played a match but my stats haven’t showed up yet, what’s the deal?  
A: The API defaults to searching for matches over the last 3 hours. To find any matches before then, you must specify a Created-at time.

######Q: Where can I find assets to use on my project?  
A: We are working on a way to have assets available to you directly from Vainglory. In the meantime, the community has put together some great resources for you in [Discord](https://discord.me/vaingloryapi). You can find them in the pinned files in #vaingloryapi-chat.

######Q: What endpoints do I have access to with the API?  
A: Check out the [Docs](https://developer.vainglorygame.com/docs)

######Q: How do I enter the API Challenge?  
A: The 2017 API Challenge submission period ended on March 26th. Check out the [list of submissions](https://developer.vainglorygame.com/rules#results).

######Q: How will API Challange prizes be distributed for my team?  
A: You can join the API Challenge with any team size up to four total. All prizes will be adjusted based on the number of members on your team (up to four).

A: Some features available include Telemetry, Bulk Sample Data,

######Q:  Where do I sign up my team, or let you know I’m part of a team?  
A: For the API Challenge, you don’t need to tell us what team you’re on. Where teams come into play is the submission portion of the challenge - when you submit your project, that’s when you’ll be asked who your team consists of!

######Q:  My team is making a mobile app.  Can we submit that?  
A:  You sure can! When submitting a mobile app, we just need to see that it works.  You can have it run on an emulator, Testflight, etc.  If you have specific questions on this reach us at api@superevilmegacorp.com

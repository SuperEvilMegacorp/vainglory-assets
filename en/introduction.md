# Vainglory Developer API Guide

![](../cover.png)

The first version of the Vainglory Game Data Service is an exciting step forward towards making it easier for users to have open access to in-game data.

Build something great!

At the moment this Service is in **Preview** mode. You can see sample data, test the interface, and provide feedback to our development team.

The Server now makes every attempt to implement the [JSON-API](http://jsonapi.org/) specification. Where a deviation occurs, it is likely unintentional and can be reported to the team in our [Discord](https://discord.me/vaingloryapi).

We show example language bindings using CURL and plan to add libraries for Ruby, NodeJS, Java, Python and more. Community contributions are welcome and rewarded with good karma \(and swag!\) You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

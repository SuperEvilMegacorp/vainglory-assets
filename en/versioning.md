## Versioning {#versioning}

We following [SEMVER](http://semver.org/) standards, using a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH versioning scheme. This means that we will increment versioning in the following way:

* MAJOR version when we make incompatible API changes,
* MINOR version when we add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner,
* PATCH version when we make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

You can see the current version and deploy date by viewing the [Status](https://api.dc01.gamelockerapp.com/status) endpoint.

## How to contribute to the Vainglory Game Data Service Documentation

#### API Requests

Any bug, question or request regarding the API system should go into one ticket each.


#### Data Requests

Any feature request or data question should be created as a pull request against [requests_telemetry.md](requests_telemetry.md) (Telemetry), [requests_match.md](requests_match.md) (data returned by `/matches`) or [requests_player.md](requests_player.md) (date returned by `/players`). It must include a detailed description and it should include a data format proposal. If this is not possible, an issue may precede a pull request.

The pull request is peer reviewed, discussed and critized by other developers. A developer community maintainer or MadGlory employee will merge the pull request, adding, removing or altering the list of feauture request that is presented to game developers regularly as-is.

# In Progress
Here will be a list of all feature requests that are currently being worked on for future updates.

## Wins, Played, Played_ranked
Seen on #78 #161 
Fix to wins, played, played_ranked. Data is currently reporting incorrectly.

# Pending
Here will be a list of all feature requests that have not been designated a Status.

## Maximum Skill Tier Achieved
Seen on #168 
Show the maximum earned VST("elo_highest" : "2333") as this will help all projects be able to show what the highest achieved trophy is throughout the season for all users.

## Current VST
Seen on #198 
Currently, `elo_earned_season_x` goes up to 7 but we are in season 8 so it provides no current VST.

## Fixing Win/Loss Streaks
Seen on #219 
Both win streaks and loss streaks can not be 0 if the player has played matches recently. Either win or loss streaks MUST be 1 or more. Both streaks being 0 is impossible once a player has played a match. Either this data is being sent incorrectly OR this data requires clarification for what it actually represents.

## Clarification on lifetimeGold
Seen on #219 
What is lifetimeGold exactly. If this does indeed represent the gold at the end of a match and not life time. How can it be a decimal when all gold earned is in whole numbers when the gold trickle went from a decimal to a whole number?
